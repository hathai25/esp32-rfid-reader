## üßê Introduction <a name = "introduction"></a>

The project includes source code for an RFID Reader with the following requirements:

#### üìÉ Functional requirement

- Read RFID Card: The ESP32 must be able to read data from RFID cards using an attached RFID reader module, capturing the unique identifier (UID) and other stored information from the card.
- Display Card Info on OLED Screen: Upon successfully reading an RFID card, the ESP32 should display the card's information, such as the UID and any additional data, on an OLED screen connected to the microcontroller.
- Activate Buzzer and LED on RFID Tap: When an RFID card is tapped and read, the ESP32 should trigger a buzzer and light up an LED to provide audible and visual feedback, indicating a successful read operation.

#### üìÉ Non-functional requirement

- Debouncing: Introducing a debounce time interval during which repeated taps of the same card are ignored to prevent duplicate reads.
- State Management: Maintaining a record of recently read card UIDs and ensuring that any repeated taps within a predefined time window are disregarded.

This schematic outlines the interconnections between an ESP32 microcontroller and various peripheral components, including an RFID-RC522 module, an OLED display, an LED, and a Buzzer. The connections are specified via General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins, designated for specific signal transmissions that enable communication between the ESP32 and the peripherals. [Software Concept](#software) below is a detailed breakdown of the connections.

## üíª Software Concept <a name = "sofware"></a>

By utilizing the GPIOs of the ESP32 and SPI & I¬≤C interface support, the project is able to control the following components:

#### ESP32 and RFID-RC522 Module

- GPIO2: This reset line is connected from the ESP32 to the RST pin on the RFID-RC522. It is used to reset the RFID module.
- GPIO5: The SS pin on the RFID-RC522 is connected to GPIO5 on the ESP32. This pin enables the ESP32 to select the RFID-RC522 module for communication over the SPI interface.

#### ESP32 and OLED Display

- GPIO21: The SDA line of the I¬≤C interface for the OLED display is connected to GPIO21. This line is used for data transfer between the ESP32 and the OLED.
- GPIO22: The SCL line of the I¬≤C interface links GPIO22 on the ESP32 with the corresponding SCL input on the OLED. This line provides the clock signal that synchronizes data transmission.

#### ESP32 and LED

- GPIO13: An LED is connected to GPIO13 on the ESP32. This setup allows the ESP32 to control the LED, turning it on or off by setting GPIO13 high or low, respectively.

#### ESP32 and Buzzer

- GPIO4: The Buzzer is connected to GPIO4 on the ESP32. By toggling GPIO4 high and low at various frequencies, the ESP32 can control the buzzer to generate different tones.


### Initialization

- Initialize the U8X8 display, LED pin, buzzer pin, and RFID module.
- Retrieve the index along with the three most recent IDs from the Preferences library.
- Display the three most recent IDs on the screen.

### Main Loop

- Check if the newly scanned card matches the previously scanned card; if it does, do not process the new card scan.
- Activate the buzzer and turn on the LED light to signal a successful scan.
- Update the storage with the three most recent card IDs and increment the counter by one.
- Save the updated values and the counter increment back to the Preferences library - which uses a portion of the on-board non-volatile memory (NVS) of the ESP32 to store data.
